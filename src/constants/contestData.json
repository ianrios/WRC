        "h4": "Winning tracks will be released on \"WHYCOMP001 - Rain\", set to release in December",
        "rules": [
            "1. Deadline: November 1st, 2020",
            "2. If you use samples, they must be royalty free",
            "3. Theme: __b__Rain__b__ (you should create a track that embodies \"rain\"; perhaps this means you use rain recordings, synthesize the sound of rain, use rain as an inspiration for your track structure / lyrics, create a rain soundscape using only sounds that are not rain, etc.)",
            "4. You cannot use \"Rain\" in your track title, as it is the album name",
            "5. No beats (drums can be used, but that kind of defeats the purpose of 'ambient', so use them creatively if you decide to use them at all)",
            "6. Submit your final track mixed and mastered to __email__ as a downloadable 44.1Khz wav file.",
            "7. Title your track __i__\"artist_name - track_name.wav\"__i__"
        ],
        "recommendations": [
            "Ambient / Drone / \"peaceful noises\" / Field Recordings / Sound Scapes / etc. are most likely to be selected for the album",
            "Collabs are good ways to make new friends and make cool sounds"
        ],
        "disclosure": "Members of WRC will be participating in the competition, as well as judging the tracks submitted. Our goal is to include as many tracks as possible, so we will probably not turn away a track unless it does not follow the rules or fit the criteria for the album.",
