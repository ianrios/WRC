			"whythough? is an electronic music producer who specializes in techno and club music. Originating from New Jersey, Ian Rios was exposed to electronic music from an early age. With roots in peruvian flutes and puerto rican rhythm, the Jersey Club scene is what initially brought Ian to more experimental genre bending music. ",
			"Growing up, he listened to every style of music he could find including death metal, classical, 80s pop, ambient drones, jazz, salsa, germanic chants, progressive rock, rap, hip-hop, and of course, electronic dance music and all of its sub-generes. Fascinated with the interesting, new sounds of synthesizers, he began to dig deeper and find more artists that made music he enjoyed, building his library with 90s house and tech, all the way to mainstream edm and avant-garde machine noises. It wasn’t until going to college in Troy, NY, where Ian learned to DJ in a producer club for shows and parties. His love for crate digging is directly translated into his enjoyment of creating playlists to expose people to new music.",
			"While initially starting out as a DJ, he quickly picked up mashups, then remixes, and finally, original tracks. Leading into 2018, he became interested in more experimental sounds, harder basses, and more technical rhythm patterns, taking inspiration from the music he grew up and loved. By taking ideas from other genres, Ian has attempted to blend all kinds of techniques to create new ways of imagining modern club and techno music in his own style."

			"Famed, fabled, and frequently berated, dyl_pykl began his lifelong downhill musical tumble at the age of 5, when he picked up the piano at the suggestion of his parents, and threw it across the room with incredible strength. Their insistence that he pursue bodybuilding, however, conflicted with the song in his soul, and he vowed never to destroy another musical instrument, with the exception of any viola. It's just a violin.",
			"He came of age in Alaska where he was first exposed to electronic music, expanding his mind to include fake and terrible music as well as REAL music played on REAL instruments. That's when he became a \"multi-instrumentalist\" and acted like a huge dick just because he bought a garbage Jackson bass and learned the line to \"Just An Old Fashioned Love Song\" by Three Dog Night, a song that no one even listens to anymore. (shoutout Three Dog Night though)",
			"dyl_pykl attended college in New York and started producing music while part of a club at his university known as PULSE, sometimes called \"People Using Live Software And Electronics\" but more often referred to as \"Pinheads Unmaking Lighting and Sound Equipment\" and twice a year publicly as \"People Undergoing Loud Sound Euthanasia.\" He developed a taste for music that people usually only listen to at three in the morning on drugs, even though it was 1:30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday in the library. He perfected his skills at Youtube University because only idiots go to music school. He now lives in Phoenix, Arizona."
